# ML Final Project
## Learning Luftrausers

This program aims to learn the game Luftrausers using deep reinforcement learning.

***

To compile the cpp file, run `cl /LD luft_util.cpp` on the 64x Visual Studio dev cmd (64 bit because TensorFlow needs 64 bit python). Once the dll is there, the python can be run normally. You can download the Visual C++ Build Tools here http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools
